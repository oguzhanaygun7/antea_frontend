  faq1Title:'What is Hair Transplantation and How does it work?',
  faq1Text:'Hair transplantation is one of the most preferred aesthetic operations of recent years. Hair loss because of many different reasons can cause the person to feel uncomfort psychologically. Many different reasons such as genetic factors, hormonal problems, stress, diseases and drug use can make permanent hair loss. Today, the most effective solution for hair loss is hair transplantation. During hair transplantation, the hair follicle is taken from the nape area or back part of head and applied to the area which has problem. The reasons why hair transplantation is chosen by many people; thanks to the development of the possibilities offered by technological devices, hair transplantation is done painlessly, quickly and easily, there is no scarring as a result of the operation and the transplanted hair is used for a lifetime.',
  faq2Title:'What should I do to have a hair transplant operation?',
  faq2Text:'Hair transplantation is not a cosmetic procedure; It is a surgical operation. It is important for the person to act with the awareness of this situation during the decision-making process of the hair transplantation procedure. A number of examinations are required to check your health and suitability for the operation. For this reason, we highly recommend that you should apply to a well-equipped hospital. During the pre-examination of hair transplantation, the quality of the hair which will be taken from the donor area and whether it will be sufficient for the application area are examined with a  special hair analysis device. Before hair transplantation, different situations  are considered  such as the thickness of the hair strand as well as the structure of the hair follicles. Straight, wavy, curly, thin or thick of  hair strand is examined. Using of these data, the coordination of the operation is provided. Before the examination the hair front line is also determined for hair transplantation. ',
  faq3Title:'Appropriate method for facial feature of the person in Hair Transplantation ',
  faq3Text:"Determining   personal  front hair line model is the most important stage of hair transplantation operation. The shape of the hair after hair transplantation is determined in the preliminary analysis which are done before the operation. For this purpose, during the examination, the hair follicles structure of the patient is examined with a hair analyzer device and the areas are determined in detail  where the thinning and baldness are experienced in the scalp. With this imaging process, the necessary graft is determined and later  the person's hairline which means the shape that should be on the forehead and the design of the temporal region in accordance with the golden ratio are performed by measuring from various angles on the face.",
  faq4Title:'Age Factor in Hair Transplantation',
  faq4Text:' Appropriate method for facial feature of the person in Hair Transplantation (PRE-LINE),  the age of the person is the most important factor to be considered in hair transplantation planning. Hair loss can start genetically at an early age and continue  at later ages. Therefore, the proper planning of hair transplantation will affect in a positive way the future of the patient. The age, food habits, smoking habits and the genetic structure of the people should be taken into consideration in the hair transplant planning of a patient in their 20s and in their 30s and 40s.The density of hair    transplantation which is applied to a person in their 30s or 40s should not be as the same as in their 20s.  An age-appropriate rarity and the rate of current hair loss should be considered and  it is also important to determine the forehead line according to those data. Ending of the current hair loss in our patients in the age group of 50 will allow us to act more flexibly.',
  faq5Title:' Donor Area In Hair Transplantation ',
  faq5Text:"The number of grafts in the donor area gives us the answer to the success rate of hair transplantation. In case of  weakness and thinness of this area in some people we recommend that an addition should be made with grafts which will be taken from different areas of head. How many grafts can be taken from the donor area should be determined very carefully. Therefore, we recommend that patients definitely to make a preliminary analysis. Some people's hair may be mixed hair type, so there may not have the same hair type in every area. Hair transplantation is done by paying attention to the color, shape and thickness of the hair which is taken from donor area. For example, curly hair can come out from the top of the ear, while wavy hair can come out from the front of the hair.While the process is being carried out,it is necessary to adjust the natural appearance to be at the forefront by adding the appropriate hair to the appropriate area.",

  womanHairText1:"Hair transplantation for women; is a service that is highly demanded by women in recent years.  Hair loss is a common health problem in women as well as men.If the type of hair loss in women is male-type loss, it can cause serious problems in the future. All kinds of cosmetic products are applied to stop hair loss.  If hair loss continues rapidly , an opening may occur in the upper part of the head. In this case, it also means that it is time to have a hair transplant,  because cosmetic products  which are used after hair loss do not grow hair, but only strengthen existing hair. Hair transplantation, which is thought to be for men, can also be applied successfully for women. Especially women's most important accessories are hair and eyebrows. Hair transplantation is successfully applied for women with developing technology.",
  womanHairText2:'HAIR TRANSPLANTATION STAGES for WOMEN;',
  womanHairText3:"Before the operation, the general health state is examined and graft detection is made and the day of the operation is decided.  Prp procedure is applied to our patient one week before hair transplation. on the day of hair transplantation, the area which will be transplanted is shaved, especially the patient's donor area is also shaved only as much as the need can be met, so that the patient can easily hide the shaved area. Grafts are taken from the donor area and extracted grafts are kept in the organ transplant solution. Hair Transplantation is performed with dhi pen or fue technique depending on the patient's condition. After hair transplation  patient does not wash hair for two days and his first wash is done by anteaclinic and 10 days later patient is asked to come back to the anteaclinic for picking scab. Within a 10-day period, the patient washes   two or three times a day. In washing processes, it is necessary to pay attention to the fact that there should not be no chemical, paraben and colorant in the shampoo. . After each washing, hair regains its natural appearance day by day. Shock loss may occur in the area where the hair transplantation is performed within 3 months. Hair regrowth begins to occur after 3 months. Hair regrowth occurs at a rate of 60-65% in the sixth month and the desired frequency is achieved between the eighth month and the twelfth month depending on the structure of each patient. It is beneficial to use vitamins, to have prp and mesotherapy procedures in order to protect the existing hair after hair transplantation. In women's hair transplantation, we recommend that our hijab women do not wear head coverings at home, especially for the first three months, and use a thin head cover that will allow the bottoms of hair to breathe when choosing  headscarves.",
  unshavenHairText1:'Unshaved hair transplantation is a method of hair transplantation that is applied without shaving the front, side and top parts of the hair. In this hair transplant method, only the donor area at the back of the head is shaved. Generally, people with long hair prefer it. Thanks to the long hair, the shaved part at the back is camouflaged by the long hair on the top. In this method, the drawing and planning of the hair transplant area is determined by the hair transplant specialist. Unshaved hair transplantation is one of the most preferred methods. It is the method of hair transplantation especially preferred by the working people (public-private sector) who do not want their hair cut. Who can be applied;',
  unshavenHairList1:'Only those who have a balding problem in the forehead area can have unshaved hair transplantation.',

  unshavenHairList3:'Those with more sparse hair on the upper part of the head can have hair tightening between the sparse hair with unshaved hair transplantation.',

  sapphireFueText:'In the Sapphire fue hair transplantation technique; hair   follicles are collected like using FUE technique. To the area where hair transplantation will be made,  channels are performed by using sapphire ore tips in the form of a pen, not with steel as in the fue method.  Using pens with tips made of real sapphire instead of steel slits provides much faster recovery than normal FUE technique . Since there is no use of steel, less tissue damage occurs and most importantly, it gives chance a much more frequent hair transplantation. It creates a more comfortable healing process for you after the transplantation. We recommend that Sapphire FUE technique to be preferred, especially by patients who have wide balding areas of the hair problem.',
  prpText1:'PRP; ( platelet-rich plasma) is drawn up into a syringe and then injected into areas of the scalp that need increased hair growth. Doctor draws blood from the patient’s arm and then put into a centrifuge (a machine that spins rapidly to separate fluids of different densities). then separates the PRP from the rest of the blood’s components. The platelet-rich plasma is drawn up into a syringe and then injected into areas of the scalp that need increased hair growth. The plasma which is obtained is quite rich in the number of cells called” platelets". Platelets, whose main task in the body is to ensure blood clotting, have an important role in wound healing thanks to the growth factors which they contain. With PRP treatment, it is possible to cure some diseases in the body and skin rejuvenation. In PRP treatment, where the patient’s own blood is used instead of medication, slowing cell regeneration is prevented, especially due to environmental and genetic factors. PRP; is used in many areas from hair loss to skin rejuvenation.',
  prpText2:'We apply PRP to our hair transplant patients for 4 sessions at one-month intervals, starting during and one month after transplantation. PRP, which is the most important complement of hair transplantation, accelerates growth  hair as well as decreases the rate of hair loss during the shock hair loss process and then helps the increasing the thickness of the hair shaft.',
  mesotherapyText:'Mesotherapy prevents hair loss by stimulating structures such as collagen and elastin under the skin. It makes the hair look brighter and more vibrant. Hair mesotherapy is a method that prevents hair loss, also provides hair growth and can be used as a treatment for baldness. It prevents hair loss by providing the necessary vitamins, minerals and nutrients in the scalp of people with balding problems. It is performed by injecting a liquid into the scalp with the help of an injector containing nutrients.  This treatment  highly beneficial and recommended after a hair transplant operation, as it nourishes and moisturizes the scalp, stimulates cell regeneration and blood flow, strengthens follicles, restores hormonal balance and eliminates infections, making our hair to look healthier and brighter. it is usually applied 4 months after the hair transplant procedure and strengthens the hair strands that have just started to grow, improves the image quality, provides you with bushy hair. When applied together with PRP treatment, it helps you see its effect faster. We recommend that you do it at least 2 times after your hair transplantation application.',
  laserHairText:'Hair laser is a treatment method applied to thicken thinning hair strands, to stop hair loss and to help new hair growth. The patient does not feel pain during hair laser application. Since the hair laser does not generate heat, it is called a non-ablative cold laser. The effect on hair follicles is based on the principle of photobiotherapy. The absorption of laser light by hair cells increases cell metabolism and blood supply of the skin. Laser beams penetrating under the scalp stimulate inactive hair follicles. Thus, by accelerating the blood circulation, it activates the cells and repairs the hair follicles. It also benefits the development of new hair follicles and thickening of thinning hair. Thanks to the treatment, the existing hair becomes stronger, the yellow hairs we call thin quince thicken and get a more voluminous appearance. In the first stage, a treatment is applied 2 times a week for 20 minutes. During this treatment, serum therapy with dermoroller support is also applied. Hair is strengthened with both laser and serum and a treatment without transplantation is provided. Before laser treatment, dermoroller serum is performed and laser is apllied to the patient. Visible effects are seen in 3 months.',
  EyeBrowTransplantText:'Eyebrow transplantation is one of the methods preferred by women. There can be many different causes of eyebrow loss. Stress, medications used, some skin diseases, injuries, physical effects such as burning, and hormone imbalances can lead to the loss of eyebrows, as well as the loss of eyebrows depending on age. It may be desirable to have sparse eyebrows and rumble these eyebrows or eyelashes. The most know that of these popularly calls “brow fussiness”. The wrong methods used to shape eyebrows in brows can sometimes cause damage, leading to reduced eyebrows or permanent loss. Our patient should come to the hospital and have a preliminary examination. Eyebrow transplant operation is performed under local anesthesia and takes approximately 3-4 hours. In eyebrow transplantation,  hair follicles which is taken from the nape area are used. For this reason, we recommend our patients to lengthen their hair before coming to the eyebrow transplantation so that we can eliminate the visual disturbance of the area which will be taken.The  hair follicles must be placed in the area to be transplanted at a certain angle and direction. In this way, an eyebrow transplant can be done in which naturalness is at the forefront while directing the eyebrows. The procedure should be carried out by considering the inclination angles of 10-15 degrees in the eyebrows. Eyebrow transplantation is performed upward in the inner region of the eyebrow, parallel to the ground as it comes to the middle, and slightly downward on the outer part of the eyebrow. Thus, a hundred percent natural appearance emerges. We recommend the DHI pen treatment in which the inclination is given easily in eyebrow transplantation. Otherwise, when the eyebrow is transplanted incorrectly, it may turn in the opposite direction or down. For this reason, eyebrow transplantation is a procedure that should be performed by experienced experts, taking into account the inclination and angle. The most important issue that patients should pay attention to after transplantation is that the scabs formed on the hair follicles should not be forced and should be treated sensitively. It is important that picking up of scabs around brows should be performed by a specialist. The patient who  will have eyebrow transplantation should not swim in the the sea or pool,  should not to be exposed to intense sunlight, not have a solarium, and  should avoid intensive sport activities for a month. From the 10th day of eyebrow transplantation, there may be falling out on the transplanted eyebrows for 3 months. Your eyebrows gets in the process of thickening and growing after the 3rd month. Your eyebrows will have their final shape between the 9th and 12th months on average. Hair which is used for eyebrow transplantation grows faster than your existing eyebrows after the transplantion. You can shape your eyebrows which gets longer with eyebrow scissors. This situation is expected to decrease after a certain period of time.',
  dhiHairPlantText1:'Detailed Information on DHI Hair Transplant Technique',
  dhiHairPlantText2:'Direct Hair Implantation ". In this method, medical pens named choi have different tip structures. As like the mechanical pen logic; pen tips allow individual application to be made according to graft thickness. All brands have tips in diameters between 0.6 mm and 1.8 mm in the market. We use 0.6, 0.8 and 1 mm tips in our DHI hair transplant process. It is important in terms of creating a natural and tight appearance. We think that the tips larger than 1mm inadequate to obtain sufficient density and natural appearance in the dhi method. 0.6 mm is generally used in eyebrow transplantation and in very thin hair for single grafts, 0.8 mm for 1 and 2 hair follicles, 1 mm: with 2-3-4 for multiple grafts. In the fue method, because the incisions are made wider than 1mm, it becomes difficult to give direction and show tight hair  work. 600-1000 grafts can be transplanted with an average pen. But this number depends on the person. The elasticity of the skin is important here. If the skin becomes bulging when the pen is dipped during planting and causes other roots to grow excessively, the tip should be changed. At the edges where the diameters of the Implanter pen are very narrow, there is a possibility that the hair follicles may be damaged while inserting into the implanter. If it is too wide, there is a possibility that the placed graft will fall off after the transplantation process. İncision widths should be between 0.2 mm-0.35 mm. The standard size of the pen needle is around 6mm - 7mm. This length is shortened or extended according to the length of the hair graft. If there is more bleeding than normal,  the length should be shortened. When we reduce the standard 7 mm needle length to 6.5 or 6 mm, we can see that the bleeding will decrease significantly. If we shorten the length more than necessary, the grafts will not reach sufficient depth and the possibility of going out will increase. Those that are planted more than normal depth will either not come out or cause a curly appearance.A mathematical proportion must be created between the length of the needle and the length of the graft. . This length should be 25-30% more than the length of the graft. For example; the graft length should be 5mm, pen needle length 7mm. The direction of the needle tip and the cleft part of the pen face to the skin when it is inserted the graft increases the probability of success. In this way, while the pointed part of the needle is inserted into the skin, its angle is made horizontal at the same time. Thus, plantation is carried out carefully to the required depth. When it is entered at a horizontal angle, it is fully compatible with the fat tissue and capillary tissue where the hair graft will join. Turning the pen while inserting  into the scarred areas or vertex area is important for depth control. During the procedure, stretching the skin with the hands of the assistant staff prevents the formation of popping(when you pierce the skin with a pen and place the graft, the placed grafts around it come out with pressure) in hair follicles. By stretching, the angle of entry of the grafts is further reduced, it allows inclined and natural hair transplantation.',
  dhiHairPlantText3:'DHI Hair Transplant Technique',
  dhiHairPlantText4:'It is the system that has highest achievement drive. grafts are collected from the donor area and then the hair which taken through pens, is placed directly into the skin without opening the incision. In common hair transplantation methods, the hair is taken from the donor area, after the channels are opened and the hair follicles are placed in the last opened channels, the process takes place in 3 stages in total. In the DHI PENCIL TECHNIQUE, the process takes place in TWO stages and the hair follicles are taken from the donor area and the hair follicles are directly transplanted with the pens. This method, which is applied without damaging healthy tissues, is advantageous in terms of allowing much more frequent transplantation, as well as providing the possibility of SHAVELESS TRANSPLANTATION since there will be no channel opening. The reason why the method is preferred;  hair follicles are placed immediately after they are taken without waiting. Thus, the success rate and the health of the grafts are higher than other methods. It is the most preferred method in recent years and its star is shining. It has become a favorite of young people, especially with the possibility of unshaven transplantation in tightening of hair.',
  dhiHairPlantList:'What are the advantages:',
  dhiHairPlantList1:'Opening channel and placing the hair follicle at the same time  directly  with the dhi pens; It ensures that the collected hair follicles do not wait for a long time outside.The success rate is higher than other methods.',
  dhiHairPlantList2:'The operation does not cause any scars or traces of plantation.  as it is worked with very fine tips. (In DHI hair transplantation, the transplantation is done by piercing the skin. In the classical FUE technique, the skin is transplanted by opening incision and the trauma scar is seen',
  dhiHairPlantList3:'One of the most important factors that provide naturalness in hair transplantation operation is the right angle. With the pen technique, the desired angles are very easily achieved in the hair transplantation process. Therefore, a natural appearance  is obtained that cannot be distinguished from the real.',
  dhiHairPlantList4:'In the DHI technique, 60 to 80 hair follicles are for per square centimeter (120 to 140 strands) in the planting area in the DHI technique. The thin tip of the pen and the design of medical structure of the tip with a comfortable inclination increase the success of natural appearance. ',
  dhiHairPlantList5:'The recipient site does not have to be shaved. Thus DHI is a more suitable procedure for people who wish to keep their hair long. Bearing in mind, the donor area does need to be shaved down, and will be done onsite, prior to the follicular unit transplantation.',
  dhiHairPlantList6:'It can be entered into thin hair and  hair densification and hair transplantation to the areas in the scalp without shaving  can be carried out easily.',
  dhiHairPlantList7:'In some patients, the desired number of grafts could not be reached due to the insufficiency of the donor area. Recently, the desired numbers have been obtained with the removal of grafts from the beard area, which we call under the chin. In beard hair transplantation, the success rate in the vertex area is higher than hair graft. It is much easier to give direction in this area in the dhi pen technique.',
  dhiHairPlantList8: 'It is the most comfortable hair transplant technique for women.',
  dhiHairPlantList9:'DHI hair transplantation is the best in eyebrow transplantation compared to other transplantation types. The angle is given much easier. Eyebrow transplantation is performed with very fine tips such as 0.6 mm. It is the only system in which single grafts can be worked. Double, triple and quadruple grafts should never be used on the eyebrows.',
  dhiHairPlantList10:'Since the angle is very important in beard transplantation applications, it is possible to get the best results with DHI hair transplantation. As is known, beards consist of single grafts, therefore double, triple, quadruple roots cannot be used.',
  dhiHairPlantList11:'Adrenaline is used to reduce bleeding in canal transplants (fue). Since there is no channel opening process, the risk of bleeding is very low due to there is no incision. There is no need to use adrenaline. It is not necessary to give isotonic liquid saline to swell the scalp. Therefore, swelling is relatively less common after hair transplantation. Therefore, complications such as necrosis due to the use of adrenaline almost never occur in DHI hair transplantation.',
  dhiHairPlantList12:'Shock hair loss is less common than other methods. ( no use of adrenalin).',
  dhiHairPlantList13:'Since  there is less trauma and damage,  first washing process can be done easily on the 2nd day. In 8 to 10 days, the patient continues his life as if a hair transplant has not been performed.',
  beardMustacheTransplantText:'In recent years, especially with the influence of social media, the idea of feeling better with aesthetic touches has become common in men as well as women. While long and bushy beard and mustache models became popular, our patients who experienced the deficiency of this situation found the solution in beard and  mustache transplantation. Beard, mustache transplantation, which is very popular not only in Turkey but also in all countries of the world, has become one of the most preferred aesthetic operations. In beard and mustache transplantation, hair  follicles are taken from the nape or neck are transplanted. In this process,, the most important element is  to determine correctly direction of growth  of moustaches and  as in hair transplantation. In order to achieve a natural appearance, it is necessary to pay attention to the direction, structure and angles of each hair follicle. In beard and mustache planting, as in eyebrow planting, inclinations should be given at certain angles of 5-10 degrees, and the thinnest tips should be used. Beard and mustache transplantation is a one-session painless procedure that lasts about 4-6 hours under local anesthesia. The next day of the procedure, slight scabs can be seen in the transplanted area. The scabbing period varies between 7 and 10 days. The hairs at the edges of the planted follicles may be exposed to shock shedding after 10 days. This situation is a normal process. After three months, the hairs begin to grow back and become thicker. The patient will have the desired amount of beard and mustache within 9-12 months.',
